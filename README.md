# Project-Weather_in_Australia
Hi,
Excited to share my first ML project on this Weather_in_Australia data set using KNeighborsClassifier,Naive_Bayes,Support Vector Machine Algorithms.

Content:
Project-Weather_in_Australia Predict next-day rain by training classification models(K-Nearest Neighbor,Naive_Bayes,Support Vector Machine) on the target variable Rain Tomorrow.

Steps implimented:-
1-Import necessary libraries
2-Read the classes in training and testing.
3-Preprocessing and Loading
4-Model select
5-Model creation and adding Convolution layer, Pooling layer,and Dense layer
6-Model compiling
7-Fit the model
8-Evaluate the model and we got 100% accuracy for training and testing data
9-Predict a new model
10-Deploy the model
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.


This project wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable support of my guid Shahadali k.t.k

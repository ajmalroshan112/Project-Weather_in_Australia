Predict next-day rain by training classification models(K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR,NAIVE BAYES,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE) on the target variable Rain Tomorrow.
Steps implimented:-
1-Import necessary libraries
2-Read the classes in training and testing.
3-Preprocessing and Loading
4-Model select
5-Model creation and adding Convolution layer, Pooling layer,and Dense layer
6-Model compiling
7-Fit the model
8-Evaluate the model and we got 100% accuracy for training and testing data
9-Predict a new model
10-Deploy the model
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
